# Sarcasm-Detection

After thorough experimentation with various models from the Hugging Face library, I have selected and fine-tuned the Twitter RoBERTa model for sarcasm detection on my specific dataset. 

This model achieved an F1-score of 53% on the positive class 1, marking one of the highest performances in the competition. This high score demonstrates the model's effectiveness in accurately identifying sarcastic content, which is a challenging aspect of natural language understanding. To ensure transparency and reproducibility, I have prepared a model verification notebook. This notebook allows others to review the testing process and see the impressive results firsthand. For those interested in further exploring or building upon this work, the best model weights are available for download. Simply download the file from the provided link, extract it to your repository directory, and run the verification notebook to replicate the results.
