# Sarcasm-Detection

After testing different models from Hugging face library for sarcasm detection I decide finally to use twitter Roberta model and finetune it on my dataset which gives me the highest F1-score on the positive class 1 with 53% which is one of the highest results in the competition.

Use the best model verification notebook after you download the best model file from the link bellowand extract it on the repo directory and you would see the results.



To get the best model wheights you can download it  :
